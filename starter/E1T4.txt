Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Currently, We can use the access key of iam user to upload and access proprietary recipes.
If unlucky, the access key is stolen and the attacker can have permission do anythings on s3 bucket
# Poor practice 2
RecipeWebServiceInstance is opening port 22
If attackers have credentials they can access the instances directly and cause damages for our system
